- nearby() doesn't work with digit boundaries: CB13.9 finds nothing because
  nothing comes between '8' and '10' alphabetically. This can be fixed with
  mandatory leading 0's, but once again the TB problem comes up -- leading
  zeroes there is kind of annoying. Maybe that latter problem can be solved by
  handling and not displaying the leading 0's.

- Ability to add entries (do events first so the DB structure is done I think).

- Split things up into modules by unit worked with: notebooks, entries, etc.

- Move add notebooks into a subset of list and add the rollback/commit options
  As Seen On Events Listâ„¢.

FEATURE REQUESTS
  (from self)
----------------

- search_entries() - this is also a frontend thing - Allow a "starts with"
  search, like the STO directory, for things like "UI" and "IT" that are often
  substrings. Maybe a case-sensitive option too?

- Printing list.

- Allow some keystroke (^C? Esc?) to cancel an active search/whatever.

- Allow the entry of simply "CB6" or so instead of separate type and num entry fields.

- Give events a definite order?
