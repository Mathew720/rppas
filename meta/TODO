Items are roughly prioritized with the most important things at the top of each
list.

BUGFIXES
========

- Don't allow deleting a notebook without deleting its events.
- Fix duplicate event handling
- Autosave entries if ^C is pressed at that screen.
- Fix case-sensitive ordering of entries returned.
- Filters are not cleared on leaving the search screen and can come back to
  haunt future searches. (Hmm, they appeared to last time I checked...do I mean
  that they come back if you press filter again?)

INTERNAL WORK
=============

- Create classes for occurrences, entries, and events, to clean things up a
  bit. Maybe a few other ones will prove useful, too, like the adding queue one
  I made already.
- Go through and look at all the #TODO's, and see what needs to be done there.

NEW FEATURES
============

Things that could cause data loss problems, or annoyance
--------------------------------------------------------

- Prevent use of "abbreviated" ranges like "25-6"
- Allow some keystroke (^C? Esc?) to cancel an active search/whatever.
- Implement validation of page numbers when adding entries
- Similarly, don't allow blank entries or page numbers

Other new features
------------------

- Allow the entry of simply "CB6" or so instead of separate type and num entry
- Don't make ntype entries case-sensitive.
- Default to non-special events, so you can press Enter for them

- Delete an individual occurrence (goes in edit entries menu)
- Start an add from the edit screen
- Start a search from the add screen

- Allow when_was queries to work on TBs
- Have some way for /strike to undo all of the things added in one go with
  commas, rather than just one.
- search_entries(): Allow a "starts with" search, like the STO directory, for
  things like "UI" and "IT" that are often substrings. Maybe a case-sensitive
  option too? Regexes?
- Allow some sort of backwards searching (give location, find entries).

- See if I can get readline?
    - Also if readline works, editing of events

- Filter index by date; add an option to the events screen to pull up index for
  that set of dates
    - Consider two-column command boxes to save space on this screen in
      particular
        - And some sort of scrolling for the events screen

- Allow inserting when modifying event lists, not just swapping. In fact,
  *just* inserting would be a much superior mode, and there should seldom be
  cause for swapping.
- Allow multiple fields in a line and tab between them, for Where was's and
  stuff.
