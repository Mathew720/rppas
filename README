The Records Project Paper Augmentation System (RPPAS)

== Dependencies ==
The only dependency likely to give you any trouble is sqlite3.

== Installing ==
Nothing needs to be installed as long as you have Python and sqlite3. You do
need to create a configuration file and database before you can use the
program, however; for that, refer to the manual in the docs/ directory.

== Documentation =
There is a full manual in the docs/ directory.
